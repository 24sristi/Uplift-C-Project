# Pharmacy Management System
The Pharmacy Management System is founded on the idea of receiving medication orders and processing payments. There is no login options in this system. Its features include taking new prescription orders, removing, and amending existing medicine orders, printing payment receipts, and viewing a daily summary of total sales. A new medicine order can be placed by the user. The user must submit the order number, name, date, number of medicine, and medicine selection in order to do so. By entering the order number, the user can erase the most recent medicine order. He or she must enter each and every detail in order to change the arrangement. Payment is made from the receipt section after orders are taken. The system prompts for a receipt number in the receipt area. The system then displays the total receipt, which includes the medicine type, name, quantity, and price. The project's final feature is the ability to view a summary of overall sales. In a list view, this part shows each and every sale record. The data is permanently stored in the system without the usage of any external files.
